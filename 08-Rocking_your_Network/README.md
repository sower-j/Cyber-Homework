# Homework 08 - Rocking your Network

This homework's deliverable was originally done in Microsoft Word as requested by the instructions. I have converted it to Markdown with `pandoc`. I only did a quick once over to fix the worst formatting in the markdown file. Please excuse any strange formatting while viewing the markdown version.

As with several of the other homeworks I feel it would have been beneficial to include more detailed information. For this homework I am lacking screenshots, or copies of command outputs I ran to make things more clear. As always I will keep the files in the same state as when I uploaded them for grading.
