### Description of Certification

The actual description of this certification is a bit vague. It is designed to be shared on Linkedin as a certificate of completion more than anything else. To obtain this certification you have to pay to get access to the quizzes and tests. The materials, including videos/lectures are free. It is intended to be a 3 week course, but can be done at your own pace.

This course covers the following:

- Azure Services and APIs and their relation to cloud computing

- Explaining the differences between Cloud deployment modes

- Identification of managed services and the difference between them

- Available Cloud Service Platforms and the scenarios they fit best

### Why Cloud Computing?

I chose this certification because I think cloud computing is interesting and I enjoyed the work we did with Azure. I have already experimented with it to some degree with a personal Digital Ocean "droplet". Lastly, I think knowledge of cloud computing is going to be important as the industry seems to be shifting towards relying heavily on the cloud as infrastructure and I want to be prepared.

### What I've Learned

- Week 1

    - **1.1 - Cloud Economics and Computing as a Utility**

        > Define what cloud computing is what what cloud services cloud
        > providers typically provide and how pricing normally works

    - **1.2 - Scalable Compute and Storage Services**

      > More information on how pricing works and why cloud has an advantage
      > in terms of scalability over local resources. Cloud as Infrastructure
      > also simplifies the management of services

    - **1.3 - Distributed Computing and Performance and Reliability**
    
      > Performance and reliability is much higher in cloud due to the ability
      > to distribute computing resources across local and cloud machines. A
      > quick overview of the types of hypervisors (Type 1, Type 2) were given
      > as well as a few visualizations of how hypervisors allocate hardware
      > across virtual machines. Lastly a brief example of what a cloud
      > management console looks like was given

Above is just a brief look at the first section of week 1. Looking ahead I can see that almost all of the topics were already touched upon by OSU's bootcamp, though this certification may go *slightly* more in depth. I feel that I could easily complete all three weeks in a day or
two instead of 3 weeks. The price for the certification is cheap so it may be worth completing just to have something else to add to my Linkedin profile.
