### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: 

    - `sudo tar -xf TarDocs.tar`

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:

    - `tar -cvvWf Javaless_Doc.tar --exclude=TarDocs/Docucuments/Java ./TarDocs` 

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:

    - `tar -tf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -i Java`

**Bonus**

Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

  - `sudo tar cvvzf ./logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=snapshot.snar --level=0 /var/log`
#### Critical Analysis Question

Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?

  - `You would not use -x and -c together in a tar command because the -c flag is used to create a .tar file; the -x command is used to extract a .tar file`

---

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

    - ` 0 6 * * 6 tar czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log `

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

    - `mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}`

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

     free > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
     df > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
     lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
     df > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:

    - `chmod a+x system.sh`

**Optional**

Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:

    - `./system.sh`

**Bonus**

Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

  - `sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly/`

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

      ```bash
      /var/log/auth.log {
      weekly
      rotate 7
      notifempty
      delaycompress
      missingok
      }
      ```

---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

    - `systemctl status auditd`

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

      ```bash
      max_log_file = 35
      num_logs = 7
      ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:

    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

      ```bash
      -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
      -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
        -w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit
      ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

    - `sudo systemctl restart auditd`

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

    - `sudo auditctl -l`

6. Command to produce an audit report:

    - `sudo aureport -au`

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
    
    ```bash
    sudo aureport -m
    48. 07/25/2021 14:39:36    1000 UbuntuDesktop pts/0 /usr/sbin/useradd attacker yes 12496
    ```

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

    - `sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron -p wra -k cron_watch`

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

    - `sudo auditctl -l`

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

    - `sudo journalctl -b -0 -p 1`

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

    - `sudo journalctl -b -0 --disk-usage`

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:

    - `sudo journalctl --vacuum-file=2`

1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

    -  `sudo journalctl -b -0 -p 2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    sudo crontab -e -u sysadmin

    @daily sudo journalctl -b -0 -p 2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    ```
