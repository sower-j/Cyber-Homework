    > The **Windows** operating system is still the most common ransomware target

17. What are "living off the land" attacks? What is the advantage to hackers?

    > Living off the land attacks use system tools/resources that are already present on the victim's machine. This is useful to hackers because it means they do not have to worry about compatibility and dependencies. This means that everything they need is there and they just need to inject malicious code or commands, which can be difficult to detect by administrators

18. What is an example of a tool that's used in "living off the land" attacks?

    > Some tools that use "living off the land" attacks include **Powershell, or the task scheduler**

19. What are zero-day exploits?

    > Zero-day exploits are attacks using vulnerabilities that are unknown to software developers

    > Zero-day exploits went from 27% (2017) to 23% (2018) meaning there was a total decrease by **4%**

21. What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?

    > Emotet and Quakbot both use malicious "living off the land" techniques to self-propagate and also brute-force passwords to gain administrative privileges. They may also use supply chain attacks to offload their malicious code onto their target systems

22. What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?

    > Supply chain attacks increased by **78%** in 2018. These attacks use third party services/software to inject malicious code into their final target

23. What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations?

    > Supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks are difficult to mitigate because they use software that is often essential and powerful (meaning it has the ability to bypass administrative privileges). They are also difficult to detect because they utilize systems that are already making changes to your system so you need to monitor core system actions to ensure malicious processes are not being run

24. The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018?

    > About **55** organizations were targeted by attack groups tracked by Symantec between the years of 2016 and 2018

    > About **49** individuals or organizations were indicted for cyber criminal activities from countries such as **Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea**

26. When it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks, what is the common theme?

    > **Poor configuration** is the most common theme when it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks

27. What is the implication for successful cloud exploitation that provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden?

    > **Speculative execution** targets cloud services because they tend to use virtual processors with a **shared pool of memory**, which means that an attack on one physical system could quickly spread to other instance/servers through the shared memory

28. What are two examples of the above cloud attack?

    > **Meltdown and Spectre** are both examples of cloud attacks

29. Regarding Internet of Things (IoT) attacks, what were the two most common infected devices and what percentage of IoT attacks were attributed to them?

    > **Routers and Cameras** are the two most commonly infected IoT devices accounting for **90%** (75% routers, 15% cameras) of all IoT attacks

30. What is the Mirai worm and what does it do?

    > The Mirai worm uses a DDos attacks using learned exploits to specifically target at IoT devices

31. Why was Mirai the third most common IoT threat in 2018?

    > Mirai was the third most common IoT threat in 2018 because it constantly updated its many exploits and expanded its target scope to include linux based servers

32. What was unique about VPNFilter with regards to IoT threats?

    > VPNFilter was unique in regards to IoT threats because it was persistent and could **survive reboots** and had several attack types and targets (MitM, credential theft, communication interception).
